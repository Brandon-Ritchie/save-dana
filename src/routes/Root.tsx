            On Dec. 6, YSU Admin presented to the Board of Trustees their plans
            to cut Danaâ€™s undergraduate degrees in Music Performance, Music
            Composition, and the complete graduate program.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Jan. 10, YSU Admin will present these cuts to a special meeting
            of the Academic Senate, as a contractual requirement to be able to
            fire faculty in those areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            By Jan. 31, an unknown number of Dana faculty will have been fired
            without cause.

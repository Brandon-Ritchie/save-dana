            On December 6, YSU Admin presented to the Board of Trustees their
            plans to cut Danaâ€™s undergraduate degrees in Music Performance,
            Music Composition, and the complete graduate program.

          <Paragraph>
            On January 7, following an uproar from the community, YSU altered
            its plans, announcing that it would instead cut programs in Music
            Composition and Jazz Studies, as well as the BA in Music.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            On January 10, YSU Admin presented these cuts to a special meeting
            of the Academic Senate, as a contractual requirement to be able to
            fire faculty in those areas.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            On January 12, YSU Admin sent out two new documents to Dana faculty,
            preparing to eliminate their positions.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            By January 31, an unknown number of Dana faculty will have been

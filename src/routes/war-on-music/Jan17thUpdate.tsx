    <h2>Update - January 17th, 2024 - 10:00pm EST</h2>
    <Paragraph>
      We promised an update with a response to Dr. Pintar’s presentation on
      January 10, and this is it. We’re going to begin at the end, when Dr.
      Pintar addressed us at the Save Dana website directly, castigating us for
      (as she implied) refusing to engage in a proper exchange of ideas.
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote>
      In higher education we expect debate about data, debate about topics
      discussing differences in opinion, sharing ideas, and challenging
      ourselves to be better.
    </Quote>
    <Paragraph>
      We would LOVE to have a debate about data, to have conversations about our
      differences of opinion, to share ideas, and to challenge ourselves to be
      better. That won’t happen until you are willing to use real data and
      represent it honestly. Start by acknowledging that you have on multiple
      occasions in recent months presented objectively false numbers and
      imaginary metrics. The fact that you have done so in order to justify
      ending student programs and firing faculty is especially atrocious.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      We conclusively demonstrated below, in our original post, that at the
      moment you told the Board of Trustees that Dana had “less than five”
      graduate students in Music Performance, there were actually 21 graduate
      students in Music Performance. You simply could have acknowledged that you
      made an error. Yet{" "}
      <AnchorLink href="https://thejambar.com/the-arts-push-back-against-cuts/">
        questioned about this by the Jambar
      </AnchorLink>{" "}
      only last week, this was your quoted response:
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote>
      I get my data from Jeanine [sic] Herman in Institutional Research and so
      you have to remember when that presentation was originally developed was
      back in September, October — when we didn’t have the Fall 2023 14th [Day]
      Enrollment Report.
    </Quote>
    <Paragraph>
      This was an incredible quote. In less than forty words, you tossed a
      colleague under the bus for supposedly providing you with bad data. You
      implied that you knew so little about Dana and its programs that you could
      be given numbers which were off by no less than 525% and not realize that
      they were incorrect. You implied that even when presenting numbers that
      could lead to student majors being cut and faculty being fired, you
      couldn’t be bothered to first verify that information for yourself. You
      implied that these numbers were supported by the available enrollment data
      in September/October, whereas on August 8, Dean Sanders sent out a
      preliminary Graduate College enrollment report showing 15 MM students in
      Music Performance. (Also, you admitted that prior to having received the
      Fall 2023 14th Day Enrollment Report, you had already determined which
      programs you intended to cut from, arguably in violation of CBA 13.1. The
      soon-to-be-retrenched faculty who now have a stronger case in future
      arbitration will thank you for this information.)
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote>
      So you can drag my name over the place, you can create a website full of
      personal attacks and hide behind your anonymity, but please ask yourself
      if after hearing what programs are going to be ending, are you really
      helping the Dana School of Music?
    </Quote>
    <Paragraph>
      Yes. Absolutely. We’re offering facts in response to fiction. We’re
      speaking on behalf of generations of brilliant students who have come
      before us, receiving a BA in Music, an MM in Jazz Studies, or a BM or MM
      in Music Composition. We’re speaking for all the other Dana students who
      benefit from the creativity of their peers in Composition degree programs,
      with whom they’re able to collaborate in bringing freshly written music
      into the world. We’re speaking for all the undergraduate students who
      benefit from having older and experienced MM Jazz Studies students as
      teachers and mentors and ensemble leaders.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      But we would like to address the first part of that sentence as well. We
      don’t feel that we’re “dragging your name all over the place” by pointing
      out objective errors in your presentations. Why have we chosen to hide
      behind anonymity? For the simple reason that the YSU Administration has
      demonstrated a propensity toward punitive retribution against those who
      speak truth to power, whether in the media or through the Union or even
      through legal action. And two recent examples strike close to home:
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In 2021, after Dana sunset its own low-enrolled Music Theory and Music
      History degrees at Administration request, there was not an iota of
      reduced need for faculty, due to the fact that all classes in these
      subjects were part of the required core curriculum for all Dana students
      in all remaining Dana majors. Nevertheless, YSU Administration retrenched
      two professors, and rather than starting at the bottom of the seniority
      list as contractually required, YSU selected Steven Reale and Randall
      Goldberg, each of whom was around the middle of the seniority list. Why
      would YSU do so? We may never know with certainty, but it is widely
      believed at Dana that YSU retrenched Reale because he had been the Union
      President who led a successful strike against the University, and that YSU
      retrenched Goldberg because he had sued the University over Dean Phyllis
      Paul’s alleged anti-Semitic rants, leading to YSU paying him a rumored
      six-figure settlement. In the end, Reale’s and Goldberg’s{" "}
      <AnchorLink href={successfulArbitration} target="_blank">
        successful arbitration
      </AnchorLink>{" "}
      of YSU’s contract violation cost the University hundreds of thousands of
      dollars in back-pay for those two professors,{" "}
      <AnchorLink href={arbitrationExpenses} target="_blank">
        arbitration expenses
      </AnchorLink>
      , and legal fees. (And years later, Phyllis Paul is somehow still Dean of
      the Cliffe College of Creative Arts).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      So again, we would love to have a debate, a discussion in which both sides
      use actual facts and figures, and we would love to help the YSU
      Administration understand how Dana works and what music students do. (To
      the best of our knowledge, neither you nor anyone else in Administration
      nor the Board of Trustees has ever once reached out to engage with Dana
      faculty in the spirit of open conversation.) But until you’re willing to
      use real data honestly, and especially until you’ve shown that you can
      have a discussion without retaliation, we’ll be forced to continue
      correcting you anonymously. You have demonstrated yourselves to be bad
      actors, and you have thus forfeited the right to cry crocodile tears about
      others not joining you in open debate. (Particularly given that for much
      of last week, you blocked access to this informational website throughout
      a public university campus, in violation of our First Amendment rights.
      FYI, we expect you’ll soon be hearing from our legal counsel about that.
      Incoming President Bill Johnson claims that YSU will be a
      “First-Amendment-friendly campus.” Administration seems not to have gotten
      that message.)
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In any case, let’s look at some of the details of Dr. Pintar’s latest
      presentation.
    </Paragraph>
    <ImageSection
      src={article132}
      alt="a slide showing pre-retrenchment information distribution"
    />
    <Quote>
      First, Administration has in fact determined that retrenchment is
      necessary in one or more programs or majors at the University. As such,
      Article 13.2 [of the faculty contract] requires a meeting of the Academic
      Senate. It also requires that a reason from Article 13.1 is acknowledged.
      That reason is as follows: “Modification, elimination, suspension, or
      reorganization of a College, Department, Program, or Major that reduces
      the need for bargaining unit faculty.”
    </Quote>
    <Paragraph>
      Administration is now locked into a justification for retrenchment of
      faculty (as required contractually). This might prove a tremendous legal
      problem for them, because at present,{" "}
      <strong>
        there has been no alteration to Dana’s Music Performance program or
        majors.
      </strong>{" "}
      Administration has neither eliminated nor suspended the BM or MM in Music
      Performance, and modification/reorganization is solely the prerogative of
      the faculty and not the Administration. Nevertheless, most or all of the
      faculty to be retrenched are to be drawn from those whom the
      Administration has designated as Music Performance faculty. How can the
      Administration justify making personnel cuts due to program
      modification/reorganization of a program that has not been
      modified/reorganized?
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Four programs will be “sunset” due to low enrollment. These four programs
      collectively have zero designated faculty, and there is zero coursework
      exclusive to those programs with the exception of individual private
      lessons for each student. Those private lessons do add up to the workload
      of approximately one full-time position. However, because Dana is so
      understaffed at present, there are currently Adjunct faculty and graduate
      students—ironically those majoring in Composition and Jazz Studies—who are
      teaching core curriculum for Dana’s surviving undergraduate majors. Those
      courses could instead be taught by one full-time faculty member. The
      workload approximately evens out, and the Administration will not
      reasonably be able to use the sunsetting of these four majors to justify
      retrenchment of even a single full-time professor.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In summary, there has been no modification, elimination, suspension, or
      reorganization—of the Cliffe College, the Dana School, or any of its
      programs or majors—which would result in any reduced need for bargaining
      unit faculty. (The soon-to-be-retrenched faculty who now have an even
      stronger case in arbitration will thank Dr. Pintar again.)
    </Paragraph>
    <ImageSection
      src={notClosing}
      alt="a slide showing the low enrollment of the four programs to be sunset"
    />
    <Paragraph>
      In discussing these four programs, we acknowledge that this time, for
      once, on the one slide above, the Administration has provided accurate
      data. To the best of our knowledge, those graduation rates are correct.
      These <strong>are</strong> small programs. But they cost the University
      nothing except perhaps paperwork. (Dr. Pintar at one point seemed to
      indicate that having to do less paperwork was partially her reasoning for
      the sunsetting.) The loss of creative voices and leadership from no longer
      having degree programs in Composition and Jazz Studies will be felt for
      the duration of the Dana School.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Dr. Pintar also added a new slide (below), listing overall numbers of Dana
      graduates by year. Why the sudden focus on graduates instead of
      enrollment? Because if Dr. Pintar instead had highlighted enrollment
      rates, her audience would have seen a School of Music whose numbers are
      increasing quickly. We’ve said this before, but it bears mentioning again:
      Dana enrollment grew about 10% between Fall ‘21 and Fall ‘23, and Graduate
      student enrollment is up about 63%. (YSU overall enrollment is down nearly
      3% in that same time span.)
    </Paragraph>
    <ImageSection
      src={twentyFaculty}
      alt="a slide showing majors with the current 20 faculty members"
    />
    <Paragraph>
      Dr. Pintar offered an insidious explanation for why she was now using
      graduation rates and not enrollment rates.
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote>
      While some may want to point to enrollment, this is only good for a
      snapshot view.
    </Quote>
    <Paragraph>
      That’s absurd; enrollment is not good only for a snapshot view. Enrollment
      rates show four-year+ trends and allow for anticipation of future
      graduation rates.
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote>
      High enrollment and low graduation rates over time signifies internal
      issues within the major. Consistently low graduation rates indicate
      students are transferring out of the major, or worse, dropping out of
      college altogether.
    </Quote>
    <Paragraph>
      Dana’s enrollment plummeted during peak Covid—just as the Administration’s
      APEEI review commenced—when collaborative performing arts like music were
      crushed. Without being able to participate in ensembles for several years,
      students transferred out of the Music major or dropped out of college
      altogether. Enrollment numbers during those years revealed what we all
      knew would be particularly low graduation rates in the years that
      followed. However, with ensembles fully functioning again—including at the
      high school level, which has led to Dana application rates returning to
      pre-Covid numbers—we all know that Dana graduation rates will soon
      increase. Dana’s enrollment rates demonstrate a rapidly growing program,
      whereas it is Dr. Pintar’s graduation rates that show the “snapshot view.”
      Dr. Pintar has cherry-picked the few numbers which support her argument.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Elsewhere in her presentation, Dr. Pintar relied upon the slide showing
      numbers from Gray Associates that we posted in our original narrative
      below, which she altered only to fix her “Pubic and Professional Writing”
      typo. As discussed previously, Gray’s representative admitted in 2021 that
      their methodologies were flawed, and then-Provost Brien Smith acknowledged
      this and assured Dana faculty that no cuts would be made based upon this
      imaginary data, which was generated without any understanding of Dana’s
      programs in particular or the music field in general.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      All that being said, Dr. Pintar avoided much talk about Gray data during
      this presentation, perhaps because the Administration’s decisions
      regarding which programs to cut go <strong>against</strong> the Gray
      recommendations on their latest{" "}
      <AnchorLink href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/61wqv1szg6qy4nwl8gbvp/h?rlkey=skdx87z8qdtpj4zlwngd3kvza&dl=0">
        scorecards
      </AnchorLink>{" "}
      (which were sent to Dana faculty on November 15, 2023). For example, Gray
      Associates rated the BM and MM in Composition “Sustain,” and they rated
      the MM in Jazz Studies “Grow.” Gray did not recommend reducing (let alone
      cutting) any program at Dana. Despite Dr. Pintar’s insistence that YSU’s
      actions are data-driven, the Administration uses only the data that’s
      convenient for them at any given time, ignoring any data that contradicts
      their decisions (which they seem to have made without the use of any data
      at all).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      We haven’t much discussed the Bachelor of Arts in Music, one of four
      programs slated to be sunset. We’ll get there in a moment. But first let’s
      read one of Dr. Pintar’s specific proposals for Dana’s BM in Music
      Performance:
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote>
      Music Performance … must immediately reorganize their curriculum to
      reflect the needs of students and create a unique and differentiated
      curriculum to give our graduates an edge. … Students who graduate from YSU
      with that degree need to have an education in more than just music. Most
      likely these students will be working in music fields or music related
      fields, where a background in business or communication or even
      engineering will give them the extra edge to become more marketable to
      employers. … By creating space in our music curriculum at YSU, the
      graduates are better positioned to compete with graduates from other
      programs. But this does create an uncomfortable change. Less courses
      within the music program in order to make our graduates more well-rounded
      means less faculty are needed in the program. However, we need to focus on
      what is best for the students. We believe this will also lead to
      improvements in student credit-hour production, as well as enrollment,
      retention, and ultimately graduation rates in the Dana School of Music.
    </Quote>
    <Paragraph>
      To summarize: Dr. Pintar wants to reorganize the curriculum of Dana’s BM
      in Music Performance by replacing some music courses with non-music
      academic classes, perhaps leaving room for a minor in another field.
      That’s <strong>literally</strong> the Bachelor of Arts in Music, a program
      the Administration just announced they’re ending due to low enrollment.
      What did they think the BA in Music was? We don’t know, but it’s that! And
      as Dr. Pintar put it herself last Wednesday:
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote>
      You know that the Bachelor of Arts in Music has not had many students in
      there E-VER. If we look back at the enrollment, there’s one student
      enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts in Music right now. It’s really a
      non-program that’s being closed.
    </Quote>
    <Paragraph>
      Administration plans to take Music Performance, a successful program,
      and—purportedly to better “reflect the needs of students”—convert it into
      what the Acting Provost referred to as a “non-program,” which she
      gleefully announced she was sunsetting due to “zero student demand.”
      Again, it is difficult to tell if Administration is maliciously trying to
      reduce Dana enrollment deliberately, or if they are simply clueless as to
      what Dana’s programs are and how they work.
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote>
      The Cleveland Institute of Music is one of your best schools in the area,
      besides the Dana School of Music, of course [snickers], and they operate
      mostly on part-time faculty.
    </Quote>
    <Paragraph>
      Wrong. The faculty teaching core curriculum at CIM are largely full-time.
      CIM’s history classes and theory classes and other required academic
      courses are nearly all taught by full-time experts in those fields, hired
      specifically for their expertise in those fields, as is the case at every
      major conservatory in the country. (But no longer at the Dana School of
      Music, where due to retrenchments and other lost positions, there are now
      no music theory specialists and only one music history specialist, whom
      you plan to retrench this month.) Directors of CIM’s required large
      ensembles are full-time. Some of CIM’s individual lesson instructors are
      also full-time. Many individual lesson instructors—most of them members of
      the Cleveland Orchestra—are part-time, but CIM offers to those faculty
      hourly pay which is as much as ten times higher than YSU’s adjunct rate.
      If YSU Administration truly believes it will be able to maintain Dana’s
      high quality of instrumental and vocal instruction by replacing Dana’s
      full-time faculty with local part-time faculty, paid at whatever appalling
      rate YSU currently offers its adjunct professors, it is in for a surprise.
      But of course they know better.
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote>
      Some top music schools such as Oberlin, Northwestern, the Eastman School
      of Music at the University of Rochester, and the University of Michigan
      even have dual major programs for their music students.
    </Quote>
    <Paragraph>
      Correct. Many music schools allow music students to double-major in music
      and another field. As the Interim Provost would know if she had some
      familiarity with Dana’s programs, one such institution is YSU’s Dana
      School of Music. Please see{" "}
      <AnchorLink href="https://catalog.ysu.edu/undergraduate/general-information/academic-policies-procedures/degrees-majors-minors/">
        this link
      </AnchorLink>
      , which Dana faculty often send to prospective students, for more
      information on how students at YSU can double-major. Incidentally, the
      schools Dr. Pintar named above do have wonderful double-degree programs,
      each of which requires five years of coursework to graduate. Her office
      recently charged Dana with restructuring and simplifying its undergraduate
      programs so that students would never require more than four years to
      graduate.
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote>
      I hope the message is clear that at YSU we put our students before
      ourselves. Our mission is to be a student-centered institution, and we
      will do what is necessary to upkeep that mission.
    </Quote>
    <Paragraph>
      YSU students are smart, savvy, sophisticated twenty-first-century adults,
      who generally share neither of the Administration’s and Board of Trustees’
      paired obsessions with money and athletics. They understand that the
      Administration and the Board are shady actors operating dishonestly with
      zero transparency. Dana students know that the community supports and
      loves them, that the faculty supports and loves them, and that the
      Administration thinks of them as pawns with a numeric value. Don’t you
      dare pretend you’re acting in the best interest of the students. You know
      otherwise, and so do they.

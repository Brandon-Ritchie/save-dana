      <h2>Update - February 27th, 2024, 10:30pm EST</h2>
      <Paragraph>
        We now have the official list of the eight full-time Dana faculty
        positions cut by the Administration. They consist of: the vocalist who
        runs the opera program; the choral conductor; the flute professor; one
        of two piano professors; the cello professor whose workload includes
        much of the theory curriculum; the wind ensemble and orchestra and YSU
        Youth Orchestra conductor; the violin professor who runs the String
        Project and teaches additional theory courses; and the only remaining
        music historian. The above, representing 40% of the current full-time
        faculty at Dana, are in their final semester teaching at YSU.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Twelve full-time faculty will remain at Dana, down from twenty-seven
        full-time faculty in 2015. The workload for nearly every one of these
        faculty members is already completely full, just from teaching required
        courses in their primary subject area(s). Few (if any) will be able to
        take on any of the teaching load that was carried by the eight lost
        positions.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        To give the reader a sense of what this will mean for the core
        curriculum at Dana, for all Dana students in the future:
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        If the Music Theory curriculum—required for all Dana majors—is the same
        next year as this year,* eight out of eleven Fall ‘24 courses will be
        taught by adjunct faculty, and eight out of ten Spring ‘25 courses will
        be taught by adjunct faculty. (This situation is worsened by the fact
        that Graduate students in Jazz Studies and Composition have been
        teaching classes in this area, and those majors have been eliminated, so
        there will be no further Graduate students in Jazz Studies or
        Composition to help out.)
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        If the Music History curriculum—required for all Dana majors—is the same
        next year as this year,* 100% of the core classes will be taught by
        adjunct faculty. Much of this curriculum (e.g., ethnomusicology and
        Medieval/Renaissance music) requires specialized knowledge that no
        remaining Dana faculty has. If we include Music History elective courses
        available to both majors and non-majors, ten out of thirteen Fall
        courses and ten out of fourteen Spring courses will be taught by adjunct
        faculty.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        If the Class Piano curriculum—required for all Dana majors—is the same
        next year as this year,* 100% of the core classes will be taught by
        adjunct faculty. Aside from Brass Methods, Guitar Methods, and Jazz
        courses, 100% of the Applied Music classroom courses—many of which are
        required for Music Education majors—will be taught by adjunct faculty.
        Conducting courses, a separate requirement, will also now be taught by
        adjunct faculty.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Less than two months ago, in announcing the upcoming cuts via email to
        the YSU community, the Administration wrote the following:
      </Paragraph>
      <Quote>
        The strong community ties built through the Dana School of Music will
        continue with the Dana Marching Band, Dana Orchestra and other ensembles
        as well as other community-based initiatives including the YSU Youth
        Orchestra and YSU String Project.
      </Quote>
      <Paragraph>
        The Dana Marching Band might continue (although without full-time
        faculty teaching any marching-band instrument aside from trumpet,
        trombone, clarinet, and percussion, it’s hard to imagine how it will
        function). But without any designated full-time faculty to teach—or
        recruit—stringed-instrument players, and with no one to lead the
        ensemble, the Dana Symphony Orchestra is finished. All faculty who might
        plausibly have conducted the YSU Youth Orchestra are gone. The faculty
        member who created and funded and administered the YSU String Project is
        gone.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Large ensembles, which are what attract most music students to their
        chosen University, have perhaps been hit hardest. There will be no
        full-time faculty member serving as director of the Dana Wind Ensemble.
        There will be no full-time faculty leading either of Dana’s choirs, and
        no full-time faculty member teaching opera. Nearly every faculty
        position involved with small ensembles (such as chamber music) is lost.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        In short, Administration has decimated Dana’s programs. How can the
        school hope to survive? The remaining faculty at Dana will meet tomorrow
        to try to come up with a plan for the future. We wish them the best of
        luck. We’ll report back when we learn what they hope to do.
      </Paragraph>
      <p className="text-sm italic">
        *The curriculum will almost certainly be the same next year. A
        department cannot quickly change requirements for a major, because these
        changes have to be approved at both the University and State levels.
        Curricular changes voted upon by faculty{" "}
        <strong>during the ‘22-23 school year</strong> have not yet gone into
        effect, and there is no indication that they will do so by Fall ‘24.

    <Paragraph>
      Yesterday, Dana faculty received a seniority list and offers of VSRP
      (Voluntary Separation or Retirement Program). Here's what that means:
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Contractually, before they can retrench faculty (fire them without cause),
      YSU Administration must release a seniority list of those faculty, because
      in principle, they are supposed to retrench the most junior faculty first.
      (YSU Administration has violated that rule in the past, and a neutral
      judge restored the jobs of those faculty members, costing YSU hundreds of
      thousands of dollars.) The seniority list is supposed to be arranged by
      "major," and all Dana faculty therefore should be listed with a "major" of
      Music, since all Dana faculty teach all music students! A "major" of Music
      would also be consistent with faculty appointment letters and contracts.
      However, YSU is cherry-picking which faculty can be retrenched by
      sub-dividing them further.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Dr. Pintar announced in her speech on Wednesday that in addition to
      sunsetting (shutting down) four smaller programs with no designated
      faculty, modifications were being made to the Music Performance program.
      (Although to date, no changes have been made to the Music Performance
      program; her premature decision to reduce faculty from that major is
      therefore a contract violation.) Fifteen out of Dana's twenty faculty have
      been arbitrarily assigned a "major" of Music Performance, and are
      therefore retrenchable. One Dana faculty has been assigned a "major" which
      doesn't exist, Music History and Literature! An unknown number of these
      sixteen faculty members will be retrenched by January 31, unless a
      sufficient number of them take the VSRP.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      VSRP is a buyout, a "voluntary retirement" package which is anything but
      voluntary (since the choice is: volunteer or be fired). Faculty who accept
      the VSRP will receive 80% of their annual take-home pay for one year, in
      order to leave quietly. The VSRP has been offered to all tenure-track and
      tenured faculty who have been assigned majors of Music Performance and
      Music History & Literature. Faculty have until January 24 to make a
      decision as to whether to take the VSRP. Unless a sizable number of
      faculty accept the VSRP, YSU Administration will retrench additional
      faculty between January 24 and 31.

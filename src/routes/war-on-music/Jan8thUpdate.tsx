    <h2>Update - January 8th, 2024, 10:00pm EST</h2>

    <Paragraph>
      The University response to the Save Dana website and petition has been
      remarkable.
    </Paragraph>
    <ul className="ml-8 list-disc">
      <li>
        Within a few hours of this website going live, it was blocked across YSU
        campus.
      </li>
      <li>
        Within about 16 hours of the website and petition going live, YSU
        announced a series of cuts to (mostly) different and smaller Dana
        programs.
      </li>
      <li>
        YSU Administrators have launched a barrage of propaganda—with various
        statements posted on social media, emailed to constituents, and leaked
        to the press—all designed to minimize the impact of the cuts they plan
        for the Dana School of Music. We’ll analyze one such statement below:
      </li>
    </ul>

        Statement addressing misinformation about YSU’s Dana School of Music
      </p>
      <p>
        Youngstown State University's Dana School of Music is NOT closing,
        contrary to social media posts.
      </p>
    </Quote>

    <Paragraph>
      We never suggested that Dana was closing imminently. Nor did anyone else,
      as far as we are aware. Rather, we made clear that Dana could not survive
      the cuts to Music Performance and Music Composition which were being
      planned. (And there is no doubt they were being planned. The Provost’s
      presentation to the Board of Trustees on December 6 was crystal clear, and
      the University had a month to correct the record if it had wanted to,
      after the subsequent Business Journal article made that presentation
      public.) Look for the “misinformation,” YSU, and you’ll find the call
      coming from inside your own house.{" "}
    </Paragraph>

      Four consistently low-enrolled majors, which have had approximately 12
      graduates in the past five years, will be sunset this academic year. These
      majors include Bachelor of Arts in Music, Bachelor of Music in
      Composition, Master of Music in Composition and Master of Music in Jazz
      Studies.
    </Quote>

    <Paragraph>
      Let’s discuss enrollment. Faculty workload was once regularly apportioned
      by the Administration for the purpose of recruitment. Yet in the past
      several years, recruitment workload hours have been almost zeroed out by
      the Administration. Provost Pintar was shocked—astounded—to learn in a
      Zoom call in recent years that Dana faculty are expected to recruit
      students. But recruitment has now simply become an expectation without any
      release time or compensation. No recruitment time given to the faculty by
      the Administration is partially what creates low enrollment.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Numbers in the Composition program in particular have suffered due to the
      lack of a designated faculty member in that area. While several faculty
      hired for other specialties have stepped up and done incredible work
      teaching Composition, Dana has had no Composition professor for
      approximately a decade, and all requests to have that faculty line
      restored have been rejected. All of Dana suffers from a lack of
      recruitment time, but it is almost impossible to recruit in an area that
      has no faculty. Furthermore, there are no designated scholarship funds for
      BM Composition students. The Administration has therefore set up our
      Composition program to fail. And it has not failed; the Composition
      program is churning out brilliant musician-scholars who have gone on to
      achieve great success in their fields. Several appear in our Testimonials
      elsewhere on this site.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Dana’s programs are interwoven. Students in each major attend nearly all
      the same classes—and play in many of the same ensembles—as students in all
      other majors. Ending a program like the MM in Jazz Studies doesn’t simply
      mean we’ll have two fewer students next year. Our MM in Jazz students are
      leaders of several ensembles, and they teach Dana undergraduate classes
      themselves (saving YSU money from needing to hire an adjunct professor).
      Neither the BA in Music nor the MM in Jazz Studies have any classes
      required strictly for those majors; they essentially cost YSU nothing. Why
      eliminate majors which are fully supported without having any designated
      faculty?
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Additionally, what does having a School of Music with no Composition
      program mean for Dana? A perfunctory examination of the “Top 100 Music
      Schools in America” on one popular site reveals that 100/100 of these
      schools have Music Composition programs. We ran out of time before being
      able to determine how far down the list we’d need to go to find a music
      school which does not offer a BM and/or an MM in Music Composition. What
      kind of company will Dana be in without a Composition degree?
    </Paragraph>

    <Quote>
      Students currently enrolled in these four majors will be able to graduate
      from their designated major.

    <Paragraph>
      We are relieved to learn that the Administration is not irredeemably evil
      (only dishonest, malicious, and shockingly inept).
    </Paragraph>

    <Quote>
      This step in Taking Charge of Our Future aligns with the Ohio Department
      of Higher Education’s review of duplicative and low-enrolled programs.{" "}

      The Dana School of Music will undergo an immediate reorganization to
      enhance and rejuvenate the school ...
    </Quote>

    <Paragraph>
      Make no mistake, this “reorganization” is Admin-speak for firing faculty.
      YSU is shuttering eight programs across campus, of which four are at Dana,
      and{" "}
      <strong>
        they announced in other posts their plan to eliminate thirteen total
        faculty positions.
      </strong>{" "}
      Quite a few of Dana’s twenty professors are about to lose their jobs.
    </Paragraph>

    <Quote>… and improve the marketability of graduates.</Quote>

    <Paragraph>
      Dana graduates are thriving regionally, nationally, and globally. The
      notion that a few pencil-pushers in Tod Hall who have never attended a
      Dana concert—and who are utterly ignorant of Dana’s programs and what its
      faculty does—could restructure a music school to improve its graduates’
      marketability, is comical.
    </Paragraph>

    <Quote>
      This reorganization allows the university to re-envision and differentiate
      the undergraduate and graduate programs in Music Education and Music
      Performance as well as continue to support Music Recording and community
      initiatives, including the YSU Youth Orchestra.
    </Quote>

    <Paragraph>
      We look forward to learning about how YSU administration envisions
      differentiating Dana’s few surviving programs after firing a number of the
      world-class specialist musicians who have been teaching them. When we find
      out YSU’s brilliant secret master plan, we’ll post it here.
    </Paragraph>

      YSU continues to value the Dana School of Music and the impact it has on
      the university and the surrounding community.

    <Paragraph>
      Two days ago, YSU was ready to slash Dana so severely that it wouldn’t
      survive the wounds. It was only an outpouring of rage and support from{" "}
      <strong>YOU</strong>, the community, that led YSU to reduce the depth of
      the cuts.

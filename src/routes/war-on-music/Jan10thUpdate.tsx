    <h2>Update - January 10th, 2024 - 10:00pm EST</h2>
    <Paragraph>
      Today outside Tod Hall, approximately 100 supporters braved freezing
      weather, rain, snow, and even a light hailstorm, to make noise in support
      of music and the Dana School.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      At the same time, Acting Provost Pintar gave an online presentation to
      YSU's Academic Senate, making public the Administration's recently altered
      plans for the Dana School of Music. She confirmed that YSU will shut down
      Dana's BM in Music Composition, MM in Music Composition, MM in Jazz
      Studies, and BA in Music, along with several other programs across campus.
      She confirmed that thirteen full-time professors in several disciplines—an
      unknown but likely sizable number of them from Dana's twenty—will lose
      their jobs.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Several Dana faculty and current students spoke in support of the Dana
      school. Dr. Ewelina Boczkowska's statement on behalf of the entire music
      faculty was particularly pointed:
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      "First, the program evaluation metrics [used by Pintar to justify these
      cuts] contain objective errors. Over the past two years the music program
      has grown by over 10%, including a 63% increase in graduate students,
      outpacing the growth of YSU at large. Gray Associates and Provost Smith
      acknowledged using flawed methods to arrive at "1% Employment Demand," and
      we have minutes to support this.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      "Second, this assault on the arts ignores how the School of Music has
      benefited the quality of life in the Valley. We are a 150-year-old music
      school, pre-dating the institution which became YSU. A petition to save
      Dana has drawn 20,000 signatures in three days, clearly showing that the
      community values what we do.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      "Third, regarding Article 13 [the portion of the faculty contract which
      governs "retrenchment"], all Dana faculty were arbitrarily assigned to
      majors that are different from our appointment letters. I was personally
      assigned to a major that doesn't even exist. Every faculty attempt to
      correct these errors was rejected without any justification.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      "In conclusion, if this proceeds, the decision to cut programs and faculty
      will have been based on false enrollment and employment data, arbitrary
      assignments of major, and a misunderstanding of the music profession that
      makes up 3% of the national economy.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      "20% of the Music faculty left YSU just last year. The School of Music
      needs stability to enhance its growth and quality. Or, imagine sporting
      events, churches, schools, bars and restaurants, museums and concert halls
      throughout the region without music. Please do not retrench in the Dana
      School of Music."
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      We'll have further updates as new information comes in, as well as an
      analysis of Pintar's presentation within a few days.

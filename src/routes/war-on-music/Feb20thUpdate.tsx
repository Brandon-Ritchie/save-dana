      <h2>Update - February 20th, 2024, 9:00am EST</h2>
      <Paragraph>
        We finally have some news about the cuts to Dana School of Music
        faculty. Eight faculty positions out of Dana's twenty full-time faculty
        have been eliminated, along with five faculty positions from other
        departments. There will be no retrenchments, because a sufficient number
        of faculty members in Dana and other programs applied for the
        “voluntary” separation package (which was anything but voluntary). The
        YSU community was treated to more gaslighting from Interim Provost
        Jennifer Pintar yesterday:
      </Paragraph>
      <Quote>
        [T]hrough collaborative efforts between the faculty and administration,
        we implemented a plan that prioritized exploring options for early
        retirement or separation before resorting to any other form of personnel
        reduction through retrenchment.
      </Quote>
      <Paragraph>
        Collaborative efforts? You threatened tenured faculty with an ultimatum:
        they would be fired without cause unless enough of them applied for a
        buyout. How exactly was their acceptance of that severance package
        collaborative? Additionally, not all faculty in the affected departments
        qualified for the buyout; at least one non-tenured faculty member was
        not reappointed, and they will leave with nothing. Did this also happen
        within the spirit of collaboration?
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Also, “exploring options for early retirement” is not some brilliant
        plan you devised last month; it’s literally a requirement within the
        faculty contracts. If you had retrenched faculty without first offering
        them a separation/retirement package, the Administration would have once
        again been spanked by a neutral arbiter, and the affected faculty would
        all have had their jobs restored. You fulfilled a contractual
        obligation.
      </Paragraph>

        I'm delighted to report that a sufficient number of faculty members
        opted for this opportunity, thus negating the need for any cuts.

        You’re delighted? Thirteen faculty who simply want to be teaching their
        students are now departing YSU, in order to make room for{" "}

        for Bill Johnson’s personal staff. Of course you’re delighted; it’s been
        clear from the start that you’ve been relishing this. (Rumors abound
        from Tod Hall that you’re sitting in Brien Smith’s office because he was
        against further cuts to faculty, and you volunteered to implement them.
        So thirteen faculty are out, and you received a nice promotion and raise
        for making it happen.) You’re <strong>delighted.</strong>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        And what is this talk about the separations “negating the need for any
        cuts”? These <strong>are</strong> the cuts. Thirteen faculty members are
        now without a job, and absolutely none of them wanted this. They took a
        severance package instead of being fired without cause and leaving with
        nothing. As you surely know, Dr. Pintar, you can put lipstick on a pig,
        but it’s still a pig.

        When we have more information about which faculty will be departing
        Dana, we’ll post updates here. In the meantime, we encourage readers to

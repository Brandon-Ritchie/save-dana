    <h2>Update - January 7th, 2024, 7:00pm EST</h2>

    <Paragraph>
      This morning, January 7, Chet Cooper, Chair of YSU’s Academic Senate, sent
      out a message to all Senators to distribute to their constituencies: “As a
      reminder, there will be a special meeting of the Academic Senate this
      coming Wednesday, January 10th, at 4:00 PM. ... The sole agenda item shall
      be hearing the Administration provide the data and information generated
      by a review of overall staff needs based upon potential programmatic
      changes. … [T]he following programs/majors are impacted: ... Music
      Composition … and Music Performance.”
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      YSU’s intention to shut down those two majors in particular—as of this
      morning!—is consistent with the Associate Provost’s slide below, the
      Business Journal article below, and many internal conversations.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      This evening, January 7, the University released a statement “addressing
      misinformation” ... “in response to social media posts,” that it was not
      closing down the BM Music Performance or the complete Graduate program,
      but only the BM in Composition, the BA in Music, the MM in Composition,
      and the MM in Jazz Studies. “The Dana School of Music will undergo an
      immediate reorganization to enhance and rejuvenate the school to better
      serve students and improve the marketability of graduates.”
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>What does all this tell us?</Paragraph>

      <li>We are being gaslighted, and</li>
      <li>We still have more work to do, and</li>

        <strong>Your posts are working!</strong> Because what happened between
        morning and evening on January 7? This website had more than 10,000
        unique views, and the related petition gathered more than 6300
        signatures (as of this message going live).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <Paragraph>
      Keep the pressure on the YSU Board and Administration. They should not be
      shuttering <strong>any</strong> music programs at Dana. Empty-suit
      administrators should not be reorganizing a School of Music to fit{" "}
      <strong>their</strong> idea of marketability—particularly a school like
      Dana with thousands of successful graduates thriving throughout the
      region, the nation, and the world. This community matters, and your voice
      matters, and the Dana School of Music matters. <strong>#lovemusic</strong>

      <h1>Youngstown State University’s War on Music</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Update - January 8th, 2023, 10:00pm EST</h2>

        <Paragraph>
          The University response to the Save Dana website and petition has been
          remarkable.
        </Paragraph>
        <ul className="ml-8 list-disc">
          <li>
            Within a few hours of this website going live, it was blocked across
            YSU campus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Within about 16 hours of the website and petition going live, YSU
            announced a series of cuts to (mostly) different and smaller Dana
            programs.
          </li>
          <li>
            YSU Administrators have launched a barrage of propaganda—with
            various statements posted on social media, emailed to constituents,
            and leaked to the press—all designed to minimize the impact of the
            cuts they plan for the Dana School of Music. We’ll analyze one such
            statement below:
          </li>
        </ul>

        <Quote>
          Statement addressing misinformation about YSU’s Dana School of Music
          Youngstown State University's Dana School of Music is NOT closing,
          contrary to social media posts.
        </Quote>

        <Paragraph>
          We never suggested that Dana was closing imminently. Nor did anyone
          else, as far as we are aware. Rather, we made clear that Dana could
          not survive the cuts to Music Performance and Music Composition which
          were being planned. (And there is no doubt they were being planned.
          The Provost’s presentation to the Board of Trustees on December 6 was
          crystal clear, and the University had a month to correct the record if
          it had wanted to, after the subsequent Business Journal article made
          that presentation public.) Look for the “misinformation,” YSU, and
          you’ll find the call coming from inside your own house.{" "}
        </Paragraph>

        <Quote>
          Four consistently low-enrolled majors, which have had approximately 12
          graduates in the past five years, will be sunset this academic year.
          These majors include Bachelor of Arts in Music, Bachelor of Music in
          Composition, Master of Music in Composition and Master of Music in
          Jazz Studies.
        </Quote>

        <Paragraph>
          Let’s discuss enrollment. Faculty workload was once regularly
          apportioned by the Administration for the purpose of recruitment. Yet
          in the past several years, recruitment workload hours have been almost
          zeroed out by the Administration. Provost Pintar was
          shocked—astounded—to learn in a Zoom call in recent years that Dana
          faculty are expected to recruit students. But recruitment has now
          simply become an expectation without any release time or compensation.
          No recruitment time given to the faculty by the Administration is
          partially what creates low enrollment.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Numbers in the Composition program in particular have suffered due to
          the lack of a designated faculty member in that area. While several
          faculty hired for other specialties have stepped up and done
          incredible work teaching Composition, Dana has had no Composition
          professor for approximately a decade, and all requests to have that
          faculty line restored have been rejected. All of Dana suffers from a
          lack of recruitment time, but it is almost impossible to recruit in an
          area that has no faculty. Furthermore, there are no designated
          scholarship funds for BM Composition students. The Administration has
          therefore set up our Composition program to fail. And it has not
          failed; the Composition program is churning out brilliant
          musician-scholars who have gone on to achieve great success in their
          fields. Several appear in our Testimonials elsewhere on this site.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Dana’s programs are interwoven. Students in each major attend nearly
          all the same classes—and play in many of the same ensembles—as
          students in all other majors. Ending a program like the MM in Jazz
          Studies doesn’t simply mean we’ll have two fewer students next year.
          Our MM in Jazz students are leaders of several ensembles, and they
          teach Dana undergraduate classes themselves (saving YSU money from
          needing to hire an adjunct professor). Neither the BA in Music nor the
          MM in Jazz Studies have any classes required strictly for those
          majors; they essentially cost YSU nothing. Why eliminate majors which
          are fully supported without having any designated faculty?
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Additionally, what does having a School of Music with no Composition
          program mean for Dana? A perfunctory examination of the “Top 100 Music
          Schools in America” on one popular site reveals that 100/100 of these
          schools have Music Composition programs. We ran out of time before
          being able to determine how far down the list we’d need to go to find
          a music school which does not offer a BM and/or an MM in Music
          Composition. What kind of company will Dana be in without a
          Composition degree?
        </Paragraph>

        <Quote>
          Students currently enrolled in these four majors will be able to
          graduate from their designated major.
        </Quote>

        <Paragraph>
          We are relieved to learn that the Administration is not irredeemably
          evil (only dishonest, malicious, and shockingly inept).
        </Paragraph>

        <Quote>
          This step in Taking Charge of Our Future aligns with the Ohio
          Department of Higher Education’s review of duplicative and

        <Paragraph>
          Make no mistake, this “reorganization” is Admin-speak for firing
          faculty. YSU is shuttering eight programs across campus, of which four
          are at Dana, and{" "}
          <strong>
            they announced in other posts their plan to eliminate thirteen total
            faculty positions.

          Quite a few of Dana’s twenty professors are about to lose their jobs.

        <Quote>… and improve the marketability of graduates.</Quote>

        <Paragraph>
          Dana graduates are thriving regionally, nationally, and globally. The
          notion that a few pencil-pushers in Tod Hall who have never attended a
          Dana concert—and who are utterly ignorant of Dana’s programs and what
          its faculty does—could restructure a music school to improve its
          graduates’ marketability, is comical.
        </Paragraph>

        <Quote>
          This reorganization allows the university to re-envision and
          differentiate the undergraduate and graduate programs in Music
          Education and Music Performance as well as continue to support Music
          Recording and community initiatives, including the YSU Youth
          Orchestra.
        </Quote>

        <Paragraph>
          We look forward to learning about how YSU administration envisions
          differentiating Dana’s few surviving programs after firing a number of
          the world-class specialist musicians who have been teaching them. When
          we find out YSU’s brilliant secret master plan, we’ll post it here.

          YSU continues to value the Dana School of Music and the impact it has

        <Paragraph>
          Two days ago, YSU was ready to slash Dana so severely that it wouldn’t
          survive the wounds. It was only an outpouring of rage and support from{" "}
          <strong>YOU</strong>, the community, that led YSU to reduce the depth
          of the cuts.

        <h2>Update - January 7th, 2023, 7:00pm EST</h2>

        <Paragraph>
          This morning, January 7, Chet Cooper, Chair of YSU’s Academic Senate,
          sent out a message to all Senators to distribute to their
          constituencies: “As a reminder, there will be a special meeting of the
          Academic Senate this coming Wednesday, January 10th, at 4:00 PM. ...
          The sole agenda item shall be hearing the Administration provide the
          data and information generated by a review of overall staff needs
          based upon potential programmatic changes. … [T]he following
          programs/majors are impacted: ... Music Composition … and Music
          Performance.”
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          YSU’s intention to shut down those two majors in particular—as of this
          morning!—is consistent with the Associate Provost’s slide below, the
          Business Journal article below, and many internal conversations.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          This evening, January 7, the University released a statement
          “addressing misinformation” ... “in response to social media posts,”
          that it was not closing down the BM Music Performance or the complete
          Graduate program, but only the BM in Composition, the BA in Music, the
          MM in Composition, and the MM in Jazz Studies. “The Dana School of
          Music will undergo an immediate reorganization to enhance and
          rejuvenate the school to better serve students and improve the
          marketability of graduates.”

        <h2>Initial Story</h2>

        <Paragraph>
          On December 6, 2023, YSU Associate Provost Jennifer Pintar gave a
          presentation to the Board of Trustees on her “Academic Master Plan,”
          which could be considered the latest salvo in the Administration’s War
          on Music. The{" "}
          <a
            className="underline"
            href="https://businessjournaldaily.com/ysu-examines-resource-reallocation-for-programs/"
          >
            Business Journal reported
          </a>{" "}
          on this presentation the following day.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Some of Pintar’s data was verifiably and blatantly false. For example,
          here was her slide regarding Graduate student enrollment at YSU:
        </Paragraph>

        <ImageSection src={graduateEnrollment} alt="graduate enrollment" />

        <Paragraph>
          She claimed that there were “less than 5” Graduate students enrolled
          in a Graduate degree in Music Performance at Dana. The
          administration’s own enrollment figures (below) show that at that time
          there were 21 Graduate students enrolled in an MM in Music
          Performance.
        </Paragraph>

        <ImageSection
          src={Enrollment2023}
          alt="actual enrollment numbers from 2023"
        />

        <Paragraph>
          Pintar also subdivided Dana’s Graduate programs by major (i.e., with
          separate line items for Music Performance, Music Theory and
          Composition, and Music Education), whereas she combined majors in most
          other Graduate programs. Dana’s robust MM program with 27 total
          Graduate students in Music should have appeared “in the green,” in her
          second column from the left, and not “in the red” on the far right.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Much of Pintar’s “data” on Dana’s undergraduate programs was
          imaginary. Here is a slide she presented to the Board of Trustees
          regarding two of Dana’s undergraduate programs:
        </Paragraph>

        <ImageSection
          src={assessment}
          alt="A slide showing data on the assessment of undergraduate programs"
          caption="(The typographical error on the bottom right was corrected on the BoT
          page weeks later. This demonstration of Pintar’s own ineptitude at
          Public and Professional Writing could be viewed as a case for the
          incorrect numbers for Graduate enrollment stemming from gross
          incompetence, rather than malicious intent.)"
        />

        <Paragraph>
          While the Administration claims that these analyses are data-driven,
          its hired analytics firm (Gray Associates) was spectacularly
          ill-equipped to scrutinize a music program. To give one example, Music
          Performance in the slide above received a 1% score in “Employment
          Demand.” When questioned in detail about this by Dana faculty at a
          meeting in 2021, Gray Associates’ representative admitted that its
          numbers were based on its findings from general job-search sites, and
          without examining the highly specific sites (usually protected by a
          paywall) used by most employers in hiring musicians for orchestras,
          bands, and other salaried positions. This Employment Demand number
          also does not take into account the freelance work which makes up
          nearly all of the paid opportunities taken by nearly all professional
          musicians. All music faculty can recall that YSU’s Provost, Brien
          Smith, even acknowledged this problem at the meeting, and that he
          assured the music faculty that no action would be taken based on this
          flawed data.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          YSU shows years of decreased enrollment due to regional and national
          demographics, but enrollment at the Dana School of Music is rising!
          Compare the Fall 2021 enrollment report (below)—taken from when Dana
          enrollment had bottomed out due to the pandemic’s effects on the
          performing arts—to the 2023 report above. In two short years, Dana
          enrollment has risen 10%, from 174 students to 191 students. (Dana’s
          Graduate enrollment is up 63%, from 17 to 27 students!) Yet in that
          same time period, overall YSU student enrollment has declined by
          nearly 3%, from 11,298 to 10,993.
        </Paragraph>

        <ImageSection
          src={Enrollment2021}
          alt="actual enrollment numbers from 2023"
        />

        <Paragraph>
          YSU’s War on Music began several years ago, after Dana’s undergraduate
          degree programs in Music History and Music Theory were shut down. The
          Administration promptly “retrenched” (fired) faculty specialists in
          History and Theory, despite the fact that the classes needed in those
          areas were unchanged, since every music student is required to take
          History and Theory! After a lengthy arbitration (informal trial), a
          neutral judge{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/iy6m42egj3zbobqxwbs3v/YSU-OEA-arbitration-award.pdf?rlkey=kf8iw74vbjdg0gozhyqw092a5&dl=0"
            className="underline"
          >
            found
          </a>{" "}
          that the Administration had violated the faculty members’ contracts,
          and restored the jobs to those faculty members.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Administration now plans to cut further positions from Dana,
          retrenching some number of additional professors. On January 10, the
          Administration will give a presentation to a special meeting of YSU’s
          Academic Senate. The Associate Provost has already informed the
          Faculty Union that some faculty designated as Music Performance
          faculty will be retrenched. The only question is who, and how many.
          All signs point to this being part of the “Academic Master Plan” to
          end undergraduate degree programs in Music Performance and Music
          Composition, as well as the entire Graduate music program. Cutting
          these majors and the complete Graduate music program will quickly
          result in the demise of the entire Dana School of Music. The only
          programs that are expected to survive this first cut are the BM in
          Music Education and the BM in Recording. Neither of these majors have
          the numbers to sustain Dana’s large ensembles and other essential
          programs. Without a functional orchestra, band, or choir, Dana will
          quickly enter a death spiral, unable to attract recruits (even in
          Music Education) in sufficient quantities to survive.
